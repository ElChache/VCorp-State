# Current Real-Time Graph Implementation Status

## ✅ What's Working
- **Backend complete**: WebSocket server + PostgreSQL triggers + REST API
- **Project creation**: Project 5 created with VCorp Standard template
- **Frontend compilation**: ClojureScript compiles without errors
- **React Flow integration**: Component structure exists
- **Architecture documented**: Column-based approach documented in real-time-graph-architecture.md

## 🚨 Current Issue: Data Loading
**Problem**: Graph shows 0 nodes because initial data isn't loading into re-frame state.

**Test Results**:
```
📊 Graph data: {
  "hasGraph": false,
  "collections": 0, 
  "jobs": 0,
  "hasData": false
}
```

## 🔧 Implementation Status

### ✅ Column-Based Architecture Implemented
**File**: `frontend/src/vcorpstate/graph.cljs`
- 7 squad columns with fixed X positions
- **Each column can have multiple independent trees** (like QA Squad example)
- Trees within a column don't connect to each other
- Document duplication strategy for cross-column dependencies
- Jobs grouped by squad, then by tree/workflow

### ✅ Component Structure
- `components/graph.cljs` - React Flow component
- `subs/graph.cljs` - Graph subscriptions  
- `events/graph.cljs` - Graph event handlers
- `websocket.cljs` - WebSocket client

### 🔍 Issue Root Cause
**Data flow not working**:
1. Frontend loads → calls `:graph/load-initial-data project-id`
2. HTTP request should populate re-frame state
3. **BUT**: re-frame state shows `hasGraph: false`

## 🚀 Next Steps for Next Agent

### 1. Debug Data Loading (Priority 1)
```bash
# Test backend API directly
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/projects/5/initial-data"

# Should return collections, jobs, squads, roles data
```

### 2. Check re-frame Event Flow
**Files to check**:
- `events/graph.cljs:21` - `:graph/load-initial-data` event
- `http.cljs` - HTTP client implementation
- Check if initial data reaches `:graph/initial-data-loaded` event

### 3. Once Data Loads, Fix Positioning
**Current positioning logic**: Jobs should appear in their squad columns but may need tweaking.

### 4. Test Column Layout
```bash
npx playwright test debug-graph.spec.js --headed
# Should show nodes in 7 columns once data loads
```

## 📍 URLs
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000/#/project/5
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:3001/api/projects/5/initial-data
- **WebSocket**: ws://localhost:3003/ws (working - shows connections)

## 📂 Key Files Modified
- `docs/real-time-graph-architecture.md` - Updated with column approach
- `frontend/src/vcorpstate/graph.cljs` - Column-based layout logic
- All other components ready and compiled

## 🎯 Goal
Get the 7-column layout working where:
- **Jobs appear in their squad columns**
- **Documents duplicated where needed**
- **Vertical flow within each column**
- **Matches the template visual design**

The architecture is solid, just need to fix the data loading issue!
